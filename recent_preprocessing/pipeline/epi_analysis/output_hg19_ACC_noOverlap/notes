Diff ACC overlapping with TFBS evidence generation:

here we intersect the diff mark sites with TFBS the pipeline is as follows: (runall.bsh)
1. take the TFBS file with different distance thresholds (10Kb, 50Kb, 200Kb, and 1Mb)
2. intersect TFBS with top/bottom 5% of diff mark sites
3. binarize the evidence: gain in the mark => 10, loss in the mark => 01

Overlap of ACC peak and TFBS evidence => go to presence_onlyEvid then run run_all
taking the overlap of TFBS and the presence of mark within TFBS in either of the stages p0 or p6 

mark for the analysis of ACC data refers to DiffACC
